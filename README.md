# CabEdge-Solutions
Drive Safe.. Drive Smart
What Does CabEdge Offer ?
This is a webapp developed by Arnab Mukherjee to recommend the ‘Zone’ the Taxi Driver should drive to, after dropping off a passenger in New York City to receive the fastest next booking depending on the time/day of the week/month. This reduces the “Waiting time between Bookings” for the drivers and increases earning potential for both the Driver and the company.

What inspired me to build this App?
The biggest issue a driver faces is the waiting time for their next booking. Every minute the driver spends on the road without a booking is a loss for both the driver and the company. CabEdge precisely recommends them the area they can drive to get their fastest booking based on their current location

Currently I have analysed 100 million trips that happened throughout New York City in 2018 by yellow cabs. The dataset can be found at this link
